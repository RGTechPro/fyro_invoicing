## Future Updates

### Deploying Updates

Whenever you make changes:

git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. Build the updated app
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Update your live site (2-3 minutes)

---

## Optional: Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain (e.g., `orders.biryanibyflame.com`):

### 1. Update Workflow File

Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

- Change `--base-href "/fyro_invoicing/"` to `--base-href "/"`
- Change `cname: false` to `cname: orders.biryanibyflame.com`

### 2. Configure DNS

In your domain provider's DNS settings:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: orders (or subdomain you want)
Value: YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
TTL: 3600
```

### 3. Enable in GitHub

Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Custom domain:

- Enter: `orders.biryanibyflame.com`
- Check "Enforce HTTPS"
- Wait for DNS check (can take up to 24 hours)

- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Site shows 404 error**

- Solution: Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
- Check: Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source is "GitHub Actions"
- Check: Repository is Public

**‚ùå Workflow fails in Actions tab**

- Click on the failed workflow to see logs
- Common fixes:
  - Update Flutter version in workflow file
  - Check pubspec.yaml for errors
  - Try: `flutter build web --release` locally first

**‚ùå Site loads but app doesn't work**

- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify base-href in workflow matches repository name
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**‚ùå Printing doesn't work**

- Printing requires browser print dialog support
- Test preview mode first
- Some features may need HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)

---
