## üîÑ Business Logic

### Leave Rules

1. **Maximum 4 leaves per month** (configurable per employee)
2. Resets every month (manual reset or automated)
3. Cannot apply if insufficient balance
4. Requires admin approval
5. Deducts from balance only after approval

### Attendance Rules

1. One check-in per day
2. Must check-in before check-out
3. Cannot modify past attendance (admin only)
4. Automatic absent marking (future feature)
5. Half-day logic (future feature)

### Salary Calculation

1. **Monthly Salary**: Base salary per month
2. **Working Days**: Typically 30 days
3. **Daily Rate**: Monthly Salary √∑ 30
4. **Leaves Deduction**:
   - If takes 3 leaves (1 unused): No deduction for unused leave
   - If takes 4 leaves (all used): Full month
   - If takes more than 4: Deduct extra days
5. **Formula**:
   ```
   Working Days = 30 - Approved Leaves
   Daily Salary = Monthly Salary / 30
   Payable Salary = Daily Salary √ó Working Days
   ```
